### Swift implementation of OpenAI's GPT-3 api

This is a Swift/iOS implementation of OpenAI's GPT-3 api.

From Wikipedia:
>Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is an autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. It is the third-generation language prediction model in the GPT-n series created by OpenAI, a San Francisco-based artificial intelligence research laboratory.

From GPT-3 (when I asked it to describe itself in plain language a second grader could understand):

>They taught a computer to be better at writing things (fiction) than a human! Awesome, right!?

To configure this demo, simply go to `OpenAIManager.swift` and update line 10:
`let openAIKey = "CHANGE-THIS-TO-YOUR-OPEN-AI-KEY"`

Then, run the project.

Paste anything you'd like in the first textfield, and then press the `Send to OpenAI` button.
